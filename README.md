# [Game of Tenzi](https://gameoftenzi.netlify.app/)
Exciting game of tenzi with multiple difficulties to choose from. <br>
Rules? Simple! Just roll the dice until they are all the same. To make it easier, click each die to freeze it at its current value.<br> 
Choose from one of the four difficulties, each offers a different approach to how the dice values are displayed. A small celebration happens after every winning game.<br> 
Current and best results are saved to your local storage which could be cleared in case those don't make you proud enough.<br> 
Dare to try to beat the impossible?

## Optimizations

The most important addition would be adding a worldwide leaderboard. Dice rolling animation and possibly dice rolling sound (with a default muted value, we don't want to scare anyone after all) could be added as well.

## Lessons Learned:

Game of tenzi has a lot of moving pieces (almost literally) and building it was packed with lessons of how to effectively useState and useEffect. Playing around with (spoiler, you were warned!) packages such as confetti and fireworks was both educational (so many options!) and fun.
